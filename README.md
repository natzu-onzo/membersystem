## Git Workflow

If you're new to git, [Code School has a nice free (and fun) introduction to get started with](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

The workflow is based on these rules:

1. The master branch is "sacred", ie it should never be committed to, pushed to or have a local version.
2. All new work is done on branches
3. Branches are merged into master via peer-reviewed pull requests on GitHub

The basic workflow commands are: 

```bash
git fetch
git checkout origin/master # move to origin master branch, this is the newest version
git checkout -b my_new_feature # create and move to new local branch named "my_new_feature"
git commit, git commit, git commit... # Work and do as many commits as you want
git push origin my_new_feature # push finished branch to GitHub
open https://github.com/kbhff/membersystem # Go to GitHub and create a pull request
```
